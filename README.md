# Project 1 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Sehr Abrar**

**Wordle** is a guessing game app where players try to guess a hidden five-letter word within six attempts. The app features a custom on-screen keyboard that users tap to input letters, shows feedback on guessed lettersâ€™ correctness, and selects a different goal word every time the game starts to keep the experience fresh.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Notes

During development, one challenge I faced was managing the communication between the keyboard and the board controllers. Ensuring that tapping on a key correctly updated the board state required careful handling of closures and delegate patterns.
